<h1>Samuel Rowland's very first paragraph: </h1>
<p>Greetings, my name is Samuel Rowland. I am a student at Villanova University. I am currently in the process of begining my Junior year. My major is Philosophy, but I am planning on completing a minor in computer science. After, I finish college I plan on applying to law school. Overall, I'm pretty content with how this year seems to be turning out.
    I have realized that I still need to write a bunch more words to fill this thing out. I'm hoping that this whole thing will work out in the end. I need something else to write about.
    I have been thinking lately, I wonder what computer science will look like in 50 years. I would wonder if coding in the sense that we understand it would even exist. I have a family friend who was one of the first people to recieve a degree in Computer Science. The information that she told me about her education, was facinating. I imagine that given another 50 years, it will look practically unrecognizable to me. I guess that's the way of the world. Time trudges on.... Oh well. I think that I have a good amount writen now.
